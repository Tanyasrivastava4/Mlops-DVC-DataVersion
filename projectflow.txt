Create git repo and clone it in local.
create code.py and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc.
# pip install dvc
How we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
Now do "mkdir S3" (creates a new S3 directory)
Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
Now it will ask to do: ("git rmr-cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
 Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.

 Again we do "dys add data/" (creates data.dvs) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
Now "dvc commit" and then "dys push"
Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
